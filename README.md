html-adder
==========

An **abomination** (calling it a *web application* feels presumptuous) 
in HTML frames that demonstrates that you can actually do calculations 
with just HTML. No JavaScript. No CSS. No server-side funny business. 
Not even shiny HTML5. HTML4! From the nineties!


Use
---

Input two binary numbers bit by bit, least significant first, by 
following the appropriate "0" and "1" links. Then recoil in *horror* as 
their sum progressively appears on-screen in **recursive framesets** 
(this is not a development model to emulate).


Try
---

It's already loaded at http://obfpen.github.io/html-adder/ where it's 
just waiting for you to try it out.
